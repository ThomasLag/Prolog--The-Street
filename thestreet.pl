/* House1 is the left neighbour House2 on a street made up of Houses if the list [House1, House2] is a sublist of Houses.
Consider a real street numbered 1 to 5 then we can consider Houses to be the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
Clearly in this example house number 3 is left neighbour of 4, and [3,4] is indeed a sublist, 
but [3, 5] isn't and we can see that [3, 5] is not a sublist (it goes [3, 4, 5]) */
